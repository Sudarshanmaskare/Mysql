A relational database consists of multiple related tables linking together using common columns, which are known as foreign key columns. 
Because of this, data in each table is incomplete from the business perspective.


A join is a method of linking data between one (self-join) or more tables based on values of the common column between the tables.



CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE committees (
    committee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (committee_id)
);

INSERT INTO members(name)
VALUES('John'),('Jane'),('Mary'),('David'),('Amelia');

INSERT INTO committees(name)
VALUES('John'),('Mary'),('Amelia'),('Joe');


/////////////////////////////-------------------INNER JOIN--------------------------
SELECT column_list
FROM table_1
INNER JOIN table_2 ON join_condition;

The inner join clause joins two tables based on a condition which is known as a join predicate.

The inner join clause compares each row from the first table with every row from the second table.

If values from both rows satisfy the join condition, the inner join clause creates a new row whose column contains all 
columns of the two rows from both tables and includes this new row in the result set. In other words, the inner join clause includes 
only matching rows from both tables.

If the join condition uses the equality operator (=) and the column names in both tables used for matching are the same, 
and you can use the USING clause instead:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
INNER JOIN committees c ON c.name = m.name;

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
INNER JOIN committees c USING(name);
///////////////////////////////////////////----------------LEFT JOIN--------------------
If the values in the two rows satisfy the join condition, the left join clause creates a new row whose columns contain all columns of the rows in
both tables and includes this row in the result set.

If the values in the two rows are not matched, the left join clause still creates a new row whose columns contain columns of the row
in the left table and NULL for columns of the row in the right table.


SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
LEFT JOIN committees c USING(name);
---
SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
LEFT JOIN committees c USING(name)
WHERE c.committee_id IS NULL;

Cross join

MySQL CROSS JOIN clause
Unlike the inner join, left join, and right join, the cross join clause does not have a join condition.

The cross join makes a Cartesian product of rows from the joined tables. The cross join combines each row from the 
first table with every row from the right table to make the result set.

Suppose the first table has n rows and the second table has m rows. The cross join that joins the tables will return nxm rows.

The following shows the syntax of the cross join clause:

SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.name AS member, 
    c.committee_id, 
    c.name AS committee
FROM
    members m
CROSS JOIN committees c;
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////---self join----------//////////////////////////
SELECT 
    CONCAT(m.lastName, ', ', m.firstName) AS Manager,
    CONCAT(e.lastName, ', ', e.firstName) AS 'Direct report'
FROM
    employees e
INNER JOIN employees m ON 
    m.employeeNumber = e.reportsTo
ORDER BY 
    Manager;
